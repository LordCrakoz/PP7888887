 PROJECT_X_DESC:0 "The storm is gathering above the ruins of civilization. Following a series of major economic and political crises across the world, new major powers emerged along with the old ones in their venture of rising to power once again. The new political landscape of the second cold war and the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2035 offers endless possibilities for hegemony and military domination as well as economic prosperity."

 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nation that once reigned supreme over her foreign dominions and seas, once rich with resources and brilliant minds. From controlling nearly 1/4 of Earth's territory, to now lying in the ruins of her former glory, England is toppled by staggering poverty and political instability. Prior to the downfall, Great Britain employed a strong isolationist policy, causing her international relationships to deteriorate not only with the European Union but with the whole world. The economic crisis of 2035 was the deathblow to the already fragile Great Britain, its citizens took to the streets protesting the current state of affairs, peacefully but some also violently. Once the dust had settled the king had fallen and for the near forseable future no new one was to be crowned."
 PAC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the great depression of 2035 the United States government has implemented a series of draconian laws as well as martial law and curfew. Commanded by the idealistic foundation of US, such as liberty, democracy and unalianable human rights, a new separatist group emerged and quickly gained power. Over the course of months their ranks grew significantly, turning them into a considerable threat to US national security. In an attempt to disrupt and sabotage activity of the group a night attack was prepared at it's HQ in Nevada. However, it was already too late and on the next day after the attack the Pacific Confederation was proclaimed. In vain, the US government recognized the newborn state and later that day resigned alltogether. A new government was elected and the state system reorganized accordingly, forming the Atlantic Confederation on the other coast of the United States."
 NEO_FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The age of french prosperity has ended in the early 21st century as France became more and more fiscally dependent on Germany due to the lack of finances to support an evergrowing welfare state. It became clear how bad things really are when the crisis of 2035 came. Much like any other european country in the wake of such global challenge, France has a choice of either maintaining the status quo of german economic hegemony, or to go against the european values of democracy and human rights in an attempt to overcome the biggest crisis in the history of mankind."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the beginning of the cold war with Russia, Germany has fruitlessly tried to achieve more economic, cultural and military independence from the USA, while still believing that US aid is quite useful but its influence on the european politics by far outweights the pros of having such powerful ally. The change was brought by the american depression of 2035, the following resignation of the american political establishment and as a result the dissolution of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Germany reacted quickly, issuing an ultimatum to all european countries calling them to unite against their common threat and for the greater good of Europe."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The successor of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Russias power rivals that of the Americas and Europe. Before the depression, Russia and China established a mutually beneficial trade partnership, wich saw the economy grow even bigger than that of the Soviet bloc. When the great depression of 2035 came crashing, distant regions saw an opportunity to call for more autonomy or even sessession, wich lead to protesting movements all over the russian east. Unable to deal with the rebellion, Russia negotiated so they wouldn't risk starting another civil war. Focusing on internal affairs, Russia saw little opportunity abroad until now, due to germanic threats to the west and a powerful power to the east. Must the motherland once again seek to defend her borders?""
 SAH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The agreement between Russia, china and USA stipulates that the front polizario will be named "Sahara comonwealth" with a liberal government and recognizing the Moroccan authority on the Western sahara and some other territory taken then of Algeria with the help of rebels.

 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Throughout last decades United States' status of global superpower has been challenged several times. However the main threat came from within. Incompetent and exessively large state apparatus, caugth up in an alliance of the economy and the state, came crashing down in the great depression of 2035. Unable to deal with deal with internal let alone external problems, US government resigned resulting in the establishment of the Atlantic Confederation."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since the proclamation of indian independence, India has been experiencing rapid growth of population exeeding population of China by 2030 thanks to geographical advantages and technological progress. Being one of the major BRICS members India also experienced robust economic growth throughout the years prior to the crisis of 2035. While the crisis has hit India quite hard, it is not the only challenge as the Kashmir powderkeg still posesses a significant threat to the fragile peace in the region."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Being one of the main threats to US economy, China has experienced rapid economic growth thanks to increased demand on traditionally US markets as well as actively investing in markets of neighbouring countires. The latter helped China establishing strong diplomatic relationships in the region making it one of the main candidates for the title of world superpower. However even such a collosus faces challenges such as growing role of the military in decision making process of the central government as well as political instability due to numerous socioeconomic issues of the past few decades."

 PROLOG_TEXT:0 "After a long friendship between the Soviet Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after 1950, in 2020 something terrible has happened, the United States accused the Soviets of incitement and influence of the communist influence and propaganda, then the Soviets also show their accusation towards NATO, and from that moment began the cold war: eastern countries in Europe demanded independence from Soviet oppression and rule, however the Baltic States, Belarus and Ukraine remained and the soviet union has not collapsed. The Soviet Union tried to restore its influence in Eastern Europe, even when there were protests against this, after all the Soviet Union has resisted this. The operation "Project 600" which was to carried out by the Soviet Union in 2028 and their goal was to hold Eastern Europe. This plan failed misserably because France, Germany and Italy supported the eastern states and after many years Europe has resisted and won the political war in 2030 . After all those events, the Soviet Union is weakened and is approaching its collapse, the EC ( European Commonwealth) has strengthened its position in Europe and became a powerful union for 30 years while the middle East is mired in chaos and revolutions just like Africa too. America has strengthened its position and began to expand its influence, NATO was disbanded and European countries formed the "European commonwealth", Brazil created their alliance with Peru Bolivian confederation and other south American nations and China started to increase their influence in throughout Asia. France lost their Superpower position caused by a economical crisis lowering funds from the GDP for the military and racial dividend within France’s population and now Germany is the new superpower in Europe. Soviets built missiles to scare the European Commonwealth but Germany and France responded a month later with new missiles themselfs. China and Russia were no longer cooperating with each other (after 2020) and they began to compete after the disbanding of NATO in 2035."
